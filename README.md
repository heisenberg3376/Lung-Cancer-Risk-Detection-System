## Description
Welcome to the Lung Cancer Risk Prediction System project! This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning model that predicts the risk of lung cancer based on crucial factors. The project includes a Python notebook for model development and a Streamlit app for real-time risk assessment.

## Features
- Utilizes the XGBoost machine learning algorithm for accurate risk predictions.
- Extracts insights from a carefully curated and preprocessed dataset obtained from Kaggle.
- Hosts a user-friendly web application powered by Streamlit, allowing users to input patient data and receive real-time risk estimates.

## Demo
Check out the [live demo](https://lung-cancer-risk-detection-system.streamlit.app/) of the Lung Cancer Risk Prediction System and see how it works in action!


## Usage
1. Open the Flask app in your web browser.
2. Input the required patient data fields.
3. Click the "Predict" button to receive the lung cancer risk prediction.

- Python (>=3.6)
- Streamlit (>=2.0)
- XGBoost (>=1.5)
- Pandas (>=1.3)
- Scikit-learn (>=0.24)
